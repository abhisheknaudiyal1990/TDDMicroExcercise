1) Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The Alarm class is responsible for both file measure the pressure and checking if it's in safe range. splited these responsibilities into separate classes PressureRange & Sensorclass.
 
	namespace TDDMicroExcercise.TirePressureMonitoringSystem
	{
		public class PressureRange: IPressureRange
		{
			private double _lowerLimit;
			private double _upperLimit;

			public PressureRange(double lowerLimit, double upperLimit)
			{
				_lowerLimit = lowerLimit;
				_upperLimit = upperLimit;
			}

			public bool IsPressureWithinSafeRange(double measure)
			{
				if (measure < _lowerLimit || _upperLimit < measure)
				{
					return true;
				}
				return false;
			}
		}
	}

	namespace TDDMicroExercises.TirePressureMonitoringSystem
	{
		public class Sensor: ISensor
		{
			//
			// The reading of the pressure value from the sensor is simulated in this implementation.
			// Because the focus of the exercise is on the other class.
			//

			const double Offset = 16;
			readonly Random _randomPressureSampleSimulator = new Random();

			public double MeasurePressure()
			{
				double pressureTelemetryValue = ReadPressureSample();

				return Offset + pressureTelemetryValue;
			}

			private double ReadPressureSample()
			{
				// Simulate info read from a real sensor in a real tire
				return 6 * _randomPressureSampleSimulator.NextDouble() * _randomPressureSampleSimulator.NextDouble();
			}
		}
	}

2) Open/Closed Principle: by introducing interfaces, we can ensure that the classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
	
	public interface IPressureRange
    {
        bool IsPressureWithinSafeRange(double measure);
    } 
	
	public interface ISensor
    {
        double MeasurePressure();
    }

3) Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Alarm class should depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations. The Alarm class is no longer responsible for creating an instance of the Sensor class. Instead, it is injected through the constructor, following the Dependency Injection principle.

	
	public Alarm(ISensor sensor, IPressureRange pressureRange)
    {
        _sensor = sensor;
        _pressureRange = pressureRange;
    }

4)	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):  The IPressureRange & ISensor interface is introduced to abstract the dependency on the PressureRange & Sensorclass.

By introducing the interface and decoupling the classes, we make the code more flexible, testable, and maintainable. It also promotes better separation of concerns, as each class has a single responsibility.
